Here you’ll find different notebooks that you can run:

- Housing1_Data_Cleaning: This notebook handles the data cleaning process. It loads the data from the .xlsx file and prepares it for modeling.
- Housing2_Data_Modeling: This notebook builds regression models using different predictors to estimate the price of a house.
- Housing3_Data_Modeling_LogisticRegression: This notebook applies logistic regression to classify whether a house is considered luxury or not, based on various predictors.

Throughout the notebooks, I’ve used several Python libraries, including:
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation,
- matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations,
- matplotlib.express for quick and interactive plotting,
- sklearn for regression and classification modeling,
- statsmodels for logistic regression,
- sys and others where needed.
